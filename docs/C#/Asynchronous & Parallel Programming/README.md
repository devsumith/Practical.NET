## Asynchronous Programming
- I/O Operations
  + Disk
  + Memory
  + Web/API
  + Database
- async/await
  + The await keyword:
    + Introduces a continuation, allowing us to get back to the original context (thread)
    + Gives us a potential result
    + Validates the success or failure of the operation
    + Continuation is back on calling thread
  + Should not use async void, it is only appropriate for event handlers (use async Task instead)
  + Exceptions occurring in an async void method cannot be caught
  + Using async and await in Asp.Net means the web server can handle other requests
  + Best Practices:
    + Never use async void unless it's an event handler or delegate
    + Never block an asynchronous operation by calling Result or Wait() *([Don't Block on Async Code](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/07/dont-block-on-async-code.html))*
    + Always use async and await together
    + Always return a Task from an asynchronous method
    + Always await an asynchronous method to validate the operation
    + Use async and await all the way up the chain
- [Task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task)
  + Task is a reference to an asynchronous operation
  + Work passed to Task.Run() is scheduled to execute on a different thread
  + Tasks swallow exceptions
  + Continuations are executed on a different thread
  + Wrapping synchronous code in Task.Run() can be dangerous. Make sure there is no blocking code.
- Task Continuation
  + Obtaining the Result of a Task
  + Handling Success or Failure
  + Validate Tasks even when not using async and await by chaining on a continuation
  + ContinueWith()
    + ContinueWith() vs await
  + ConfigureAwait()
    + ConfigureAwait(false) should be used when we don't care about the original context
    + Shoule use ConfigureAwait(false) when writing libraries
    + [ConfigureAwait FAQ | .NET Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/configureawait-faq/)
- Task Cancellation
- Task Completion
  + Getting Result or Exception from a Task
  + Task.WhenAll()
  + Task.WhenAny()
- Task.Delay() vs Thread.Sleep()

## Parallel Programming
- Parallel programming lets us break down a large problem and compute each piece independently
- When to use Parallel Programming
  + CPU bound operations
  + Independent checks of data
- Parallel Programming in .NET
  + Thread
  + Task Parallel Library
  + Parallel Extensions
  + Parallel LINQ
- Notice: Misusing parallel principles in Asp.Net can cause bad performance for all users
- Processing a collection of data in parallel
  + [Parallel Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.parallel)
  + Parallel.Invoke()
  + Parallel.For()
  + Parallel.ForEach()
- Working with Shared Variables and Collections
  + Locking
  + Concurrent Collections
